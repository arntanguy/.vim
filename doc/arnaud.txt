    OMNICPPCOMPLETE                             *a-omnicppcomplete* {{{2
    Omnicppcomplete is a completition plugin. It completes the code, maily
    the c++ ones.
    It is based on ctags, so it requires a tags file, which can be created
    with:
    ctags -R --c++-kinds=+p --fields=+iaS --extra=+q .
    Then, the autocompletition is with <C-x><C-o> (automatically called in
    my config)
    See |omnicppcomplete.txt|

    structures, and re-open it easily.

    It is a plugin to surround text with caracters like {,(, "...
    - cs({  : replace (...) with { ... }
    cs(}  : replace (...) with {...} (without spaces)
    cs{<q> : replace {...} with <q>...</q>
    - ds{ : delete {}
    - ys[text element]{ : surround text element with {}
    Example : "_Hello dear friends"
    ys2w[ will give you "[ Hello dear ] friends"
    - Visual selection surrounding:
    press V or v, and then select text. Press S and type your
    surrounding character (it can be html tags).
    See |surround.txt|

    ALTERNATE                               *a-alternate* {{{2

    MATCHIT                                 *a-matchit* {{{2
    It allows you to configure % to match more than just
    single characters.  You can match words and even regular
    expressions.
    Also, matching treats strings and comments (as recognized by the
    syntax highlighting mechanism) intelligently.
    The default ftplugins include settings for several languages:
    Ada, ASP with VBS, Csh, DTD, Essbase, Fortran, HTML, JSP
    (same as HTML), LaTeX, Lua, Pascal, SGML, Shell, Tcsh, Vim, XML.
    (I no longer keep track, so there may be others.)
    The documentation (included in the zip file) explains how to configure
    the script for a new language and how to modify the defaults.
    See |matchit.txt|

    ,cl OR ,cr OR ,cb |NERDComAlignedComment|
